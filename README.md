Course work from CS-305 SNHU

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client?  Aretemis Financial is an international consulting company that develops individualized fiancial plans for their customers.  What issue did they want you to address?  They want to modernize with the most current and effective software security. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? I did well with the manual review and mitigation plan.  

Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing? Software security can make or break a company.  The loss of customer trust is devasting to business. 
This is why its important to code securely from the beginning of the project to the end and constantly review and update as threats appear. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?  The challenging part for me was identifying which vulnerablities should be supressed.

How did you increase layers of security?  Started with a manual review of code, using a RESTFUL API, then static testing, and adding a secure socket layer certificate. 

In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?  Using all the tools you have access to is the best way to assess vulnerabilities.  Mitigaton depends heavily
on functionality of the program. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure?  Make security a priority for every team member and seek to expand my knowledge on secure coding practices. 

After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?  Retesting after every change in code lets you test to see if you introduced new vulnerablities. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?  I liked the RESTFUL api.  I need to learn more about secure coding as this was just surface level. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. 

What might you show future employers from this assignment?  That I have a foundation on which to build that stresses the importance of secure coding from the beginning.
